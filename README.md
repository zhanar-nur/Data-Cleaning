# Data Cleaning for a pioneer in Data Science

## Introduction

### Goal
The goal of this work is to perform the first step of the Data Science analysis, which is the data cleaning. This analysis contains basic steps of the data cleaning, which is suitable for pioneers in this field such as myself.

### Motivation
I am a new in Data Science field, and this analysis is my practice to master data cleaning techniques which are fundamental steps to perform upon the beginning of any analysis as it improves the quality of data, thus increases overall productivity. When data is clean without incorrect or outdated information, then it can produce reliable analysis.

### Data
2019 Airbnb dataset for New York City will be used for the analysis. The dataset is public and available in Kaggle.

### Libraries
You need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scipy

### Summary
The analysis shows that there cannot be a single recommendation for data cleaning as various solutions can be applied to clean the data depending on data type, importance of variables, volume of missing data etc. So, in order to apply the most appropriate method for data cleaning, a Data Scientist should understand the purpose of the analysis and have thorough knowledge of data cleaning techniques and their implementation.
